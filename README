Description:
------------
This plugin for the Linux Video Disk Recorder VDR imports EPG data from
external sources in XMLTV format and enhances the DVB EPG with that including
links to pictures. The file(s) in XMLTV format must be provided by one (or
more) additional grabber which are not part of this plugin.
The elements to be imported can be configured selectivly by channel and type of
event (movies, series or all).
Additionally the episode info from www.eplists.de is optionally
integrated.

Please be aware that depending on the EPG data quality not in every situation
a match for a DVB event can be found in the external events.

Requirements:
-------------
VDR 2.4.5+
libsqlite3
libxml2

Installation and Configuration:
-------------------------------
- compile plugin (or install from your distribution) as usual
- configure the locations of several files in <VDR-config-path>/conf.d/50-xmltv4vdr.conf
- choose at least one EPG grabber and execute for each grabber:
  - get the additional grabber executable from its source location
  - put the executable and the configuration file in /var/lib/epgsources
  - start VDR and go to the plugin settings of xmltv4vdr
  - for each EPG source enable it in the sub-menu and set parameters as required
  - for each provided channel of the EPG source you want to import into VDR enter the sub-menu and:
      1. choose a source
      2. select all VDR channels to map to
      3. select the flags which info should be available to VDR
      for convenience the flags can be copied with the blue button (or deleted with the
      yellow button) to all other configured source channels


Episode Lists
-------------
The plugin supports optionally the episodes info of www.eplists.de.
It uses a local SQLite DB for faster queries and the database is updated before
each EPG update from external sources. The update con be configured either to
fetch the episodes info directly from the server (internet connection required)
or it reads them from a local directory with episode files.
UTF-8 format is mendatory for the episode files.

To enable any of the update methods ....

To use the update directly via internet configure the
To use a local directory for the updates download the files regularly
via cron, e.g.:
   05 01 * * * vdr /usr/bin/svdrpsend-ng.pl -d www.eplists.de -p 2006 -c -o /srv/vdr/episodes TGET newer than $(($(date '+\%s')-$(stat -c %Y \"$(ls -t1 /srv/vdr/episodes/*|head -n 1)\")+3600)) seconds >/var/log/eplists 2>&1
and define in xmltv4xml.conf the location of the local episode DB (e.g. --episodesdb=/srv/vdr/episodes).
iIf the path of the episode diretory should be different from the default
<Plugin-ResourceDir>/episodes you can define it with the --episodes parameter.

The series and episode info is also written in XML format into the AUX field of the events. It
can be read by any other plugin. or e.g. svdrpsend LSTE <channel No> at <timestamp> :
#> svdrpsend LSTE 1 at 1721585700
.....
215-@ <xmltv4vdr><season>53</season><episode>16</episode><episodeOverall>1199</episodeOverall></xmltv4vdr>
....

EPG images
----------
Dowloaded EPG images are stored in <EPGsources-Dir>/<epg-source>-img. If a
matching event is found they are soft-linked to the cache dir (default:
<Plugin-CacheDir>/epgimages) in the format <channeld-ID>-<Event-ID>_<Number>.jpg
where number begins with 0. Skin plugins can acces them with this schema to show
them in EPG events.

To have the images also available in recordings they need to be copied by a
recording hook script into the recording folder e.g. with the script provided

It can be modified with the plugins setup menu and is not intended to be edited.

/var/lib/epgsources/*
---------------------
for each EPG source:
   - a folder for EPG images (if any) named <epg-source>-img
   - for xmltv files provided via file interface the xmltv file named <epg-source>.xmltv
   - a configuation file named <epg-source> with the following structure:
     line 1:  mode;00:00;P;I
         where mode is file or pipe
               00:00 start time (unused)
